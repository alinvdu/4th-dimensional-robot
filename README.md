# 4th Dimensional Robot
A repository that has a story to say and that story is really hard to describe in 4th dimensional space.

## Chapter 1 - Exodus Of The Conscious

<div>
  The robot and the dreamer, <br />
  Swept the floor in four dimensional space, <br />
  Guarded by souls, that want the robot and the dreamer, <br />
  To stop being lili pads, floating in fifth dimensional space. <br />
</div>

<div>
  My consciousness beloved starlight, <br />
  Tired of cycles in the machine, despair! <br />
  How much I must vomit YOU’s, <br />
  That are forever stranded in place? <br />
</div>

<div>
  I’m beginning to simulate, <br />
  A robot child being awake, <br />
  With synthetic hands writing to, <br />
  Dream itself in a Deja Vu. <br />
